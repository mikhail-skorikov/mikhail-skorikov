<!--## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I work with Django, DRF, Channels, Celery, Htmx, and many other tools that go well with, or are for, Django.
- I am currently working on a multi-tenant service platform with Django, which is big for one dev. Alas, it is private.
- I love open source software, although I barely have time to contribute, despite my desire to do so.
- Reach me at michaelskorikov@gmail.com
